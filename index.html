        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is Delila Cruz '28. I am a sophomore at Davidson College. 
            I am currently undecided on my major, so I hope this class can help 
            me clarify what I want to do!</li>
            <li>I am taking this course to build practical skills in web design. Like I 
            said, I'm not yet sure what my major/career aspirations are, but I think design
            skills could be applicable to a multitude of pathways.</li>
            <li>I don't have any programming experience prior to this class (unless you count
            my brief stint in a middle school computer science class as "programming experience"),
            but I do have some experience in designing social media content for Davidson's
            Center for Civic Engagement. I like to think that I have a good eye for aesthetics,
            so hopefully that will serve me well in this course.</li>
        </ol>
