        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is Delila Cruz '28. I am a sophomore at Davidson College. 
                I am currently undecided on my major, so I hope this class can help 
                me clarify what I want to do!
            </li>
            <li>I am taking this course to build practical skills in web design. Like I 
                said, I'm not yet sure what my major/career aspirations are, but I think design
                skills could be applicable to a multitude of pathways.
            </li>
            <li>I don't have any programming experience prior to this class (unless you count
                my brief stint in a middle school computer science class as "programming experience"),
                but I do have some experience in designing social media content for Davidson's
                Center for Civic Engagement. I like to think that I have a good eye for aesthetics,
                so hopefully that will serve me well in this course.
            </li>
            <li>I chose to follow the tutorial on file organization and naming conventions. 
                The biggest takeaway from this tutorial is that it's important to pick a naming 
                convention and consistently stick to it so that you can find things efficiently later. 
                General advice from the tutorial includes using all lowercase when naming files 
                (because the internet is case-sensitive!), using hyphens or underscores instead of spaces,
                avoiding abbreviations, and using version numbers/dates to practice good iterative design.
                The tutorial gives a few examples of popular naming conventions, but seems to subtly recommend
                snake_case and kebab-case as the best conventions, since those are the two that follow the
                suggestions outlined in the rest of the tutorial.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Projects of Interest</h2>
        The overarching theme of the projects below were that they are media forms of some things
        I have been pondering on recently. Generally, I tend to like stuff that calls attention to
        things that we wouldn't normally question.
        <ol>
            <li>
                <em><a href="https://pippinbarr.com/it-is-as-if-you-were-doing-paperwork/">
                    It is as if You Were Doing Paperwork</a></em>: This project was remarkable
                    to me because it made me consider just how redundant and pointless certain everyday
                    tasks (like paperwork) truly are. I think normally people tend to not question certain
                    status quo facets of life (like going to work and doing paperwork), so this project could
                    inspire people to look for more out of their lives.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em><a href="http://www.learningtoloveyoumore.com/index.php">Learning to Love You More</a></em>: This project 
                intrigued me for reasons opposite to the "Paperwork" project above. I like how it encourages people to 
                romanticize parts of their daily life through a series of prompts. Sometimes people forget about the 
                little things that make life so great, so this was a cool project to see.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em><a href="http://www.learningtoloveyoumore.com/index.php">Data Will Help Us</a></em>: The best
                way I can describe this project is "vaguely menacing." It exposes the dark side of our relatively
                newfound obsession with data and suggests that humans haven't tapped into their hearts as much as 
                we have tapped into this newfound data obsession. I also find the choice of typeface and 
                font color to be intriguing, and I wonder why they chose it.

<!--The only part of this project that I fond slightly difficult was managint the flow of code from
Github/VSCode/Desktop. I understand why these tools are so helpful, they just take a second to figure 
out.-->
